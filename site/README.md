# CS50 Web final project by Andrii Borko

## Online-shop 'Shop of happiness'

This is a shop, that I've made for practicing my knowledge in 
web-development using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python and Django

Although it's possible to find some docker or postgres files in my project, because I've made it to deploy via Docker and using PosgreSQL.

Here you can see models created for Users, Categories, Products,
Carts, Orders etc.

Using self written Javascript and using jquery library some functions such as messaging of successfull login, order or changing the number of products in cart are made without reloading the page. 

Using self written css and Bootstrap library the project is made respectively to modern requirements of responsiveness.

With the help of Django are made such things as user-friendly admin pannel with a lot of filters and layouts.
Django-paginator is very helpful when there is a big amount of displayed items.

Fixtures were made, when project was moved to PostgreSQL

Some tags were made for more comfortable working 

Thanks for reading
